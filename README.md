# Density-based-traffic-control-system---using-Arduino-uno-IR-sensor-
The purpose of this project is to alleviate traffic congestion in urban areas through  the implementation of an innovative traffic control system. By dynamically adjusting  traffic signals based on traffic density, the system aims to optimize traffic flow and  improve overall transportation efficiency.
